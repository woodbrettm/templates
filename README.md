## Node & Browser Compatibility

The project is configured to enforce JS compatibility using both `.browserslistrc` and the `engines.node` entry in `package.json`.
SCSS browser compatibility is also enforced using the `.browserslistrc` file.

- [eslint-plugin-compat](https://github.com/amilajack/eslint-plugin-compat) enforces browser compatibility. To remove it, uninstall the package and remove `"plugin:compat/recommended"` from your `.eslintrc.json` file under `extends:` as well as the `compat` item in the `plugins:` array.

- [eslint-plugin-node](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node) enforces node compatibility using the `engines.node` entry in `package.json`. To remove it, uninstall the package and remove `"plugin:node/recommended"` from your `.eslintrc.json` file under `extends:` as well as the `node` item in the `plugins:` array.

- [stylelint-no-unsupported-browser-features](https://github.com/ismay/stylelint-no-unsupported-browser-features) enforces browser compatibility for SCSS. To remove it, uninstall the package and remove `stylelint-no-unsupported-browser-features` from the `plugins:` array in the `.stylelintrc.json` file.


## Vite

Vite is configured to:

- Compress assets using Brotli. GZip is another option.
- Optimize SVGs and images
- Minify for production
- Combine duplicate media queries, selectors and autoprefix styles based on the browser versions specified in `.browserslistrc`


## Installation

Run the `yarn install` command to set up the node_modules folder. If you want to try out yarn plug n play, remove
`nodeLinker: node-modules` from `.yarnrc.yml` before installing. Note the config isn't tested with that, so you'll likely need to adjust things to work.
